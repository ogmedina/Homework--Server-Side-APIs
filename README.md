# Homework--Server-Side-APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Full Stack Boot Camp Homework 5 - Weather Dashboard

### Description

This is the fifth assignment for the UTSA Full-Stack Bootcamp. This is a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve data for cities.

* Dashboard has search functionality with form inputs.

* When a city is searched the current and future conditions for that city are presented and added to the search history.

* Weather conditions are shown with the city name, the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, 
the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

* When the UV index is viewed you are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

* When you click on the city in the search history, you are presented with current and future conditions for that city.
